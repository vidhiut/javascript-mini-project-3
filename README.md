Problem Statement
Develop a web application that creates a responsive animation based on mouse movement within the browser window. 
The application should ensure that as the mouse approaches the edge of the window, 
the colored square element lags behind the mouse cursor, only catching up and following it again once the mouse moves a certain distance away from the square.

#gsap for smooth animation
